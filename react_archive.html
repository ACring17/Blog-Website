<p>This is the React.JS collection of thoughts and resources made by Drew. This is a great resource for those looking to learn react or to find some tips and tricks. Make sure to check the time stamp to get the most relevant information. As with any libary React evolves and new standard practices are introduced. The older posts will still be available for some nuggets of information.</p></div>

<h2><a href="index.html#nineteenth-article"> Learning through React through a tutorial</a></h2>
<time datetime="04-28-2021">Apr. 28, 2021</time>
<p> I found web developer on Youtube that had some great information on getting into web development and the basics one needs to know to be job ready for this field. I found a tutorial he posted on learning react with a simple to-do/ task-manager. I thought I would give it a try and follow along for my first react project. Though he is very knowledgeable I find that he is not a great teacher. He breezes through the code and complex ideas introduced through react without teaching what is really going on. I find it hard to keep up and kow which parts are important and find myself just copying what he types without knowing what I am really doing. </p>

<p> I have found tutorial in the past with better teachers and felt like I have learned a great deal of knowledge from the tutorials. With this one I feel that I am just wasting my time and just copying and pasting someone else's work. I feel that I am cheating on this project and that I am only hurting myself. I will continue to follow along with the tutorial but I do not think that I will post this project on github or try to spin-it as my own work. Rather use it as a way to get my first taste of what it's like working with the react libary. A valuable lesson from this is that not all experts are great teachers. </p>

<p> Now that I am feeling comfortable with the basics of JavaScript, I feel confident enough to learn how to use React.JS. I have spent the last week watching videos and reading the documentation on how to use it and I think I am starting to see the pattern in the design. I have learned that React is a library and not actually a framework. It makes react easy to incorporate into projects. I have also learned that React can use vanilla JavaScript syntax to use most of Reactâ€™s methods. I am still trying to learn and understand JSX and how Babel is used to translate the code, but I am slowly understanding how it all connects. </p>

<p> My goal is for the next day off from work is to start my next project and have React be a big component so I can practice and get familiar with the library and how to use it. It seems pretty straight-forward with how to build components and understanding how the flow of data is in only one direction. I feel that I might be missing some of the small, nuanced uses and set-ups for it to work properly on a project. React has been exciting to learn and has really spiced up JavaScript for me. I just need to decide on a project to build and I will be on my way!</p>
