<p>This is the React.JS collection of thoughts and resources made by Drew. This is a great resource for those looking to learn react or to find some tips and tricks. Make sure to check the time stamp to get the most relevant information. As with any libary React evolves and new standard practices are introduced. The older posts will still be available for some nuggets of information.</p></div>

<p> Now that I am feeling comfortable with the bsics of JavaScript, I feel confident enough to learn how to use React.JS. I have spent the last week watching videos and reading the documentation on how to use it and I think I am starting to see the pattern in the design. I have learned that React is a libary and not actually a framework. It makes react pretty easy to incorporate into projects. I have also learned that React can use vanilla JavaScript syntax to use most of react's methods. I am still trying to learn and understand JSX and how Babel is used to translate the code but I am slowly understanding how it all connects. </p>

<p> My goal is for the next day off from work is to start my next project and have React be a big componet so I can practice and get familiar with the libary and how to use it. It seems pretty straight-forward with how to build componets and understanding how the flow of data is in only one direction. I feel that I might be missing some of the small nuanced uses and set-ups for it to work properly on a project. Reeact has been very exciting to learn and has really spiced up JavaScript for me. I just need to decide on a project to build and I'll be on my way! </p>
