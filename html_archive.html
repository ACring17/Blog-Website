<p>This is the HTML collection of thoughts and resources made by Drew. This is a great resource for those looking to learn HTML or to find some tips and tricks. Make sure to check the time stamp to get the most relevant information. As with any language HTML evolves and new standard practices are introduced. The older posts will still be available for some nuggets of information.</p></div>

<h2><a href="index.html#sixth-article">Understanding HTML</a></h2>
<time datetime="02-26-2021">Feb. 26, 2021</time>
<p> The way I view HTML is our way of communicating to the machine how to label each bit of data we want to display for the user. The programmer can be as creative as they want to be with the tags they want to use for each piece of data they feed into the mahine. Though if the programmer gets too creative it can confuse other programmers that will look at the code next. I have learned that there is plenty of speicalty tags to give each piece of information so that you can manipulate with css rules later and can get real creatvie with the webpage design.</p>

<p> As I learn and practice more, I learn that there is so many creative ways to label and manipulate the document. Slowly learning that HTML has more capabilities than just putting a label on a paragragh of words. That the structure we give the document is important to the foundation of the web page. Clean and organized structure will make the code much easier to understand and maintain.</p>

<h2><a href="index.html#first-article">Learning HTML</a></h2>

<p>After spending a couple months struggling to learn and understand python. A friend in the tech industry told me to look into learning front end design.He informed me that HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the building blocks to almost every website on the internet. After doing some research on forums, videos, and blogs, I decided it was time to change gears and focus on learning the core languages of front end web design. Starting with HTML.</p>

<p>HTML was very encouraging early on. After really struggling with understanding the concepts of python, it was nice to see the simplicity of using HTML. I learned that it is a mark-up language that is used to help the browser understand the main content of the web page. A way for the programmer to communicate to the browser what the label of each section should be. HTML took only a week or so to fully understand what the concepts were. HTML is not a very flashy language to learn but it is very important to understand so that thte foundation of the website is solid and organized. I visualize HTML to be the bones of the site and that having solid structure and organization will really help out later when the web site gets more complex.</p>
