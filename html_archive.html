<h2><a href="#intro-main">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>Welcome to Drew's Coding Journey! This is a blog to help Drew track his progress from newby to programmer. Drew will be able to showcase his websites and show off some of the technical skills he has learned from his readings and time spent practicing. This site will be comprised of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal will be to test out new skills and develop a fully functioning website. Would like to add a search option to find certain date entries, keywords in the blog, find common ideas and such. Going to use flex box to set up the layout of the website.</p>

<p>Consider this to be a sort of rough draft for Drew's portfolio for when he starts applying for jobs i n the tech field. This blog will supplement his Git Hub and help show recruiters, hiring managers, and companies the progress and thought process Drew has as he learns to code. It will be a place for Drew to catalog his thoughts and help him process his learning. Maybe one day it can be a source of information to come back too and help others on their coding journey.</p>

<p><strong>Below will be a catalog of Drew's projects and blog entries to give insight into his problem solving.</strong></p>

<h2><a href="html_archive.html#sixth-article">Understanding HTML</a></h2>
<time datetime="02-26-2021">Feb. 26, 2021</time>
<p> The way I view HTML is our way of communicating to the machine how to label each bit of data we want to display for the user. The programmer can be as creative as they want to be with the tags they want to use for each piece of data they feed into the mahine. Though if the programmer gets too creative it can confuse other programmers that will look at the code next. I have learned that there is plenty of speicalty tags to give each piece of information so that you can manipulate with css rules later and can get real creatvie with the webpage design.</p>

<p> As I learn and practice more, I learn that there is so many creative ways to label and manipulate the document. Slowly learning that HTML has more capabilities than just putting a label on a paragragh of words. That the structure we give the document is important to the foundation of the web page. Clean and organized structure will make the code much easier to understand and maintain.</p>

<h2><a href="code_fundamentals.html#fifth-article">Coding Fundamentals: Consistency is Key</a></h2>
<time datetime="02-17-2021">Feb. 17, 2021</time>
<p> With coding fundamentals I will be talking about key lessons learned while in my coding journey. Ideas and topics that will be helpful to revisit and teach other learn lessons that are important to me. The first one will be about the lesson of perseverance and consistency. These lessons and skills are not only important for coding but in life in general.</p>

<p> I have found that coding is very similar to fitness, in that to become great and be the envy of everyone in the field is a long journey of working hard and being consistent. To see results with weight training one must be consistent with lifting heavy weights on a regular baisis. To be able to run a marathon one must have regular running routine. similarly I have learned that in order to learn code one must find a routine and practice regularly. I have found that when I am consistent with my coding practice the skills seem to stick in my head and become natural to me. I create a new route for my brin to function.</p>

<p> When I take a break or lose motivation from coding I find it to be hard to get back into the rythm of learning and practicing. Through just getting a little bit done for coding I can use the 1% of getting better and let it grow over time. That 1% will continue to grow each day and compound into mastery of the language. The goal should not be to rush through the lessons and learn the concepts fast, but to truly learn the lesson and take my time learning  the concepts. When I feel lack of motivation I need to remember that action will help show me success, which will in turn help me create motivation and momentum in learning. Even if you feel dumb, keep learning and practicing. Eventually it will amount into mastery!</p>

<h2><a href="project_ideas.html#fourth-article">Project Idea #1: Change of address directory</a></h2>
<time datetime="02-10-2021">Feb. 10, 2021</time>
<p> I have been so busy working on fine-tuning this website that I have been forgetting to log enrties in along the way. This post will be the the first article for the project ideas page. This project came to me as I am getting ready to move this weekend. The idea is it will be a directory of all the organizations and services needed to be contacted for a move. The idea came to me as I stressed over thinking about all my mail, voter registration, and setting up the utilities. I have not done any research into it but it seems like it would be a handy tool to have. All the services and contact information for everything needed for a move.</p>

<p> The idea is to create a site that is an all in one site where the user logs-in and can track all the different authorities they need to contact about a change of address. List the agencies name, the current address they have listed and a link to where the user must go to change the address listed. For mail, voting, deliveries, MVD, car registration and such like that. A quick way for those who move to keep all their information up to date. Creating submition forms with all the relevant information and then creating forms for the user to see all the services and organizations needed to contact before the list. Almost like a todo list for moving, but the site comes with all the relevant contact information.</p>

<p>It seems like a fun twist on a normal todo list while also incorporating fun new lessons and challenges for me to take on. This idea has beeen fun to think and flush out and cannot wait to get started on it.</p>

<h2><a href="javascript_archive.html#third-article">Learning JavaScript</a></h2>
<time datetime="01-22-2021">Jan. 22, 2021</time>
<p> JavaScript has proven to be the hardest of the three languages of front end development. I gained a lot of confidence learning the mark-up languages of HTML and CSS where it is pretty straight forward witht the commands and inputs. While JavaScript seems to be more computational, it seems my hardest lesson is learning and understanding the best way to utilize JavaScript. I need to be better about my practice time with JavaScript and make it more of a daily habit till i fully grasp it. It can be a bit overwhelming at times and makes me feel fatigue. It is for sure the first language that makes me feel the imposter syndrome that comes with programming.</p>

<p>Feeling extra motivated to learn JavaScript this year and start my career in coding. I feel like I am so close to getting over the learning curve of JavaScript. With continued practice I know I will one day eventually master the front end languages. Once I master JavaScript I know it will open the door to many programming and tech opportunities. I like the challenge and cannot wait to taste the sweet flavor of success.</p>

<h2><a href="css_archive.html#second-article">Learning CSS: The Basics</a></h2>
<time datetime="01-13-2021">Jan. 13, 2021</time>
<p>Cascading Style Sheets(CSS) has been a little more challenging than HTML to learn. It has to do with the depth at which CSS can alter the HTML document. CSS is where the styling and art of computer programming comes together to alter the appearance of the website for the user. If HTML is the bones, than CSS is the skin and appearance of the body. CSS allows for a set of rules to be implemented for different element tags. I am learning that CSS has a lot of depth and can be implemented in a lot of creative ways to really make a web site dynamic and visualy appealing to the user. CSS can also make the website easier to navigate and be user friendly for people with disabilities.</p>

<p> CSS is another mark-up language and is seems to be pretty straightforward. List the element you would like to target and then list the changes you would like the browser to apply. Where it gets tricky is knowing the scope of the which rules. Some rules can be set globaly to apply to the whole body tag, while also having the ability to set up IDs to specificly target a certain tag within the HTML. It comes down to what the programer wants to edit and adjust on the website.</p>

<p>I feel like there is so much more to CSS I can still learn. That I am only scratching the surface of it's potential. So far CSS has been my favorite language to learn and implement.</p>

<h2><a href="html_archive.html#first-article">Learning HTML</a></h2>
<time datetime="01-12-2021">Jan. 12, 2021</time>
<p>After spending a couple months struggling to learn and understand python. A friend in the tech industry told me to look into learning front end design.He informed me that HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the building blocks to almost every website on the internet. After doing some research on forums, videos, and blogs, I decided it was time to change gears and focus on learning the core languages of front end web design. Starting with HTML.</p>

<p>HTML was very encouraging early on. After really struggling with understanding the concepts of python, it was nice to see the simplicity of using HTML. I learned that it is a mark-up language that is used to help the browser understand the main content of the web page. A way for the programmer to communicate to the browser what the label of each section should be. HTML took only a week or so to fully understand what the concepts were. HTML is not a very flashy language to learn but it is very important to understand so that thte foundation of the website is solid and organized. I visualize HTML to be the bones of the site and that having solid structure and organization will really help out later when the web site gets more complex.</p>
