<p>When I first started learning to code I relied on the opnion of people in coding community formums and YouTube to decide which language I should start with. The general opinion was that python is the future of coding and would be a great language to start with. I spent about 3 months reading and watching tutorials to try and grasp the concepts that make python. While the syntax was easy to understand and construct, I found it really challenging figuring out what I could do with these data structures.</p>

<p> Once I hit a point of uncertanty and did not know what to do next I reached out to a friend that works with back-end stack and uses SQL databases. He recommended I get a start with front-end stack and learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It was a total game changer and really got me excited about learning more about coding. I loved being able to see what I was creating and see the magic of web development.</p>

<p>While I have been enjoying the front-end stack and learning web development, I would one day like to come  back and relearn python and add it to my understanding of programming. Python has been a great foundation for JavaScript and helping breeze through the fundamentals and knowing what each data structure is and how  it is used. Python will be a handy tool to have down road and I cannot wait to learn it again.</p>
