<p>This is the collection of thoughts on Python and resources found by Drew to be helpful. This is a great resource for those looking to learn Python or to find some tips and tricks. Make sure to check the time stamp to get the most relevant information. As with any language HTML evolves and new standard practices are introduced. The older posts will still be available for some nuggets of information.</p></div>

<p>When I first started learning to code I relied on the opnion of people in coding community formums and YouTube to decide which language I should start with. The general opinion was that python is the future of coding and would be a great language to start with. I spent about 3 months reading and watching tutorials to try and grasp the concepts that make python. While the syntax was easy to understand and construct, I found it really challenging figuring out what I could do with these data structures.</p>

<p> Once I hit a point of uncertanty and did not know what to do next I reached out to a friend that works with back-end stack and uses SQL databases. He recommended I get a start with front-end stack and learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It was a total game changer and really got me excited about learning more about coding. I loved being able to see what I was creating and see the magic of web development.</p>

<p>While I have been enjoying the front-end stack and learning web development, I would one day like to come  back and relearn python and add it to my understanding of programming. Python has been a great foundation for JavaScript and helping breeze through the fundamentals and knowing what each data structure is and how  it is used. Python will be a handy tool to have down road and I cannot wait to learn it again.</p>
