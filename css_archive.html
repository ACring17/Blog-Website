<h2><a href="#second-article">Learning CSS: The Basics</a></h2>
<time datetime="01-13-2021">Jan. 13, 2021</time>
<p>Cascading Style Sheets(CSS) has been a little more challenging than HTML to learn. It has to do with the depth at which CSS can alter the HTML document. CSS is where the styling and art of computer programming comes together to alter the appearance of the website for the user. If HTML is the bones, than CSS is the skin and appearance of the body. CSS allows for a set of rules to be implemented for different element tags. I am learning that CSS has a lot of depth and can be implemented in a lot of creative ways to really make a web site dynamic and visualy appealing to the user. CSS can also make the website easier to navigate and be user friendly for people with disabilities.</p>

<p> CSS is another mark-up language and is seems to be pretty straightforward. List the element you would like to target and then list the changes you would like the browser to apply. Where it gets tricky is knowing the scope of the which rules. Some rules can be set globaly to apply to the whole body tag, while also having the ability to set up IDs to specificly target a certain tag within the HTML. It comes down to what the programer wants to edit and adjust on the website.</p>

<p>I feel like there is so much more to CSS I can still learn. That I am only scratching the surface of it's potential. So far CSS has been my favorite language to learn and implement.</p>
