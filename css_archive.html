<h2><a href="index.html#ninth-article">The Depths of CSS</a></h2>
<time datetime="03-08-2021">Mar. 08, 2021</time>
<p> As I practice and continue learning more about CSS I am seeing the depth of the language and it is truly an amazing language. With just the basics you can apply colors and fonts you want but that is just the simple uses for the language. I am learning CSS can help structure the webpage using CSS Grid or through flex box layout. Both call upon the HTML elements to create a structure for the page to appear aestheically pleasing and easier to read and navigate. </p>

<p> CSS also has the power to make the website feel for responive to the user with changes in appearances with whatever the size of the screen the user is accessing the page from. By using media queries the document can change its styling to improve its readability for the user. A clever way to simlify the code and put it all in one spot instead of giving the browser more documents to read. CSS can also apply some animation to the page to be more dynamic. I still have much to learn about CSS but excited to see what other cool features this language has. </p>

<p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) has been a little more challenging than HTML to learn. It has to do with the depth at which CSS can alter the HTML document. CSS is where the styling and art of computer programming comes together to alter the appearance of the website for the user. If HTML is the bones, then CSS is the skin and appearance of the body. CSS allows for a set of rules to be implemented for different element tags. I am learning that CSS has a lot of depth and can be implemented in a lot of creative ways to really make a web site dynamic and visually appealing to the user. CSS can also make the website easier to navigate and be user friendly for people with disabilities. </p>

<p> CSS is another mark-up language and is seems to be straightforward. List the element you would like to target and then list the changes you would like the browser to apply. Where it gets tricky is knowing the scope of the which rules. Some rules can be set globally to apply to the whole-body tag, while also having the ability to set up IDs to specifically target a certain tag within the HTML. It comes down to what the programmer wants to edit and adjust on the website. </p>

<p>I feel like there is so much more to CSS I can still learn. That I am only scratching the surface of its potential. So far CSS has been my favorite language to learn and implement. </p>
