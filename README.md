# Blog-Website
A website to log and track my progress on coding.

Welcome to Drew's Coding Journey! This is a blog to help me track my progress from newby to developer. I will be able to showcase lessons and ideas I have as I learn the skills needed to be a developer. This site was great practice on using IDs, CSS, and using navigation icons.
