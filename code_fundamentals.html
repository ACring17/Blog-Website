<p>This is the collection of general coding fundamentals by Drew. This is a great resource for those looking to for comoon practices and waysto clean up their code. Make sure to check the time stamp to get the most relevant information. The older posts will still be available for some nuggets of information.</p></div>

<h2><a href="index.html#tenth-article">The Sea of Knowledge</a></h2>
<time datetime="03-10-2021">Mar. 10, 2021</time>
<p>Coding is a whole other universe with it's own set of rules. There is so much knowledge to learn and absorb that it can be overwhelming. I can be a bit of a perfectionist when it comes to learning and understanding a topic that I get lost in all the information. I want to try and learn everything about a topic all at once and become a master of a language in no time. </p>

<p>I find myself losing motivation when I get overwhelmed by the sheer volume of information I know I have to learn. I need to reshape my view of the journey ahead. I will not become a programmer without taking my time and practicing a little bit everyday. Use a big chocalate bar as imagery. I will just nibble away at the choclate bar until it is all gone, bit by bit and day by day. One day I will get there. Patience and disipline will be important on this coding journey.</p>

<h2><a href="index.html#fifth-article">Coding Fundamentals: Consistency is Key</a></h2>
<time datetime="02-17-2021">Feb. 17, 2021</time>
<p> With coding fundamentals I will be talking about key lessons learned while in my coding journey. Ideas and topics that will be helpful to revisit and teach other learn lessons that are important to me. The first one will be about the lesson of perseverance and consistency. These lessons and skills are not only important for coding but in life in general. </p>

<p> I have found that coding is like fitness, in that to become great and be the envy of everyone in the field is a long journey of working hard and being consistent. To see results with weight training one must be consistent with lifting heavy weights on a regular baisis. To be able to run a marathon one must have regular running routine. Similarly, I have learned that to learn code one must find a routine and practice regularly. I have found that when I am consistent with my coding practice the skills seem to stick in my head and become natural to me. I create a new route for my brin to function. </p>

<p> When I take a break or lose motivation from coding, I find it to be hard to get back into the rythm of learning and practicing. Through just getting a little bit done for coding I can use the 1% of getting better and let it grow over time. That 1% will continue to grow each day and compound into mastery of the language. The goal should not be to rush through the lessons and learn the concepts fast, but to truly learn the lesson and take my time learning the concepts. When I feel lack of motivation, I need to remember that action will help show me success, which will in turn help me create motivation and momentum in learning. Even if you feel dumb, keep learning and practicing. Eventually it will amount into mastery! </p>
