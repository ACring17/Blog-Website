<h1><em>Drew's Coding Blog</em></h1>
<div id="intro-main"><!--This allows for the linking of atricles so users can find articles easier. This is a test on the main introduction to show how it works and help set up the links for the articles.-->
<h2><a href="#intro-main">Introduction</a></h2>
<p class="center-align">Welcome to Drew's Coding Journey! This is a blog to help Drew track his progress from newby to programmer. Drew will be able to showcase his websites and show off some of the technical skills he has learned from his readings and time spent practicing. This site will be comprised of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal will be to test out new skills and develop a fully functioning website. Would like to add a search option to find certain date entries, keywords in the blog, find common ideas and such. Going to use flex box to set up the layout of the website.</p>

<p>Consider this to be a sort of rough draft for Drew's portfolio for when he starts applying for jobs i n the tech field. This blog will supplement his Git Hub and help show recruiters, hiring managers, and companies the progress and thought process Drew has as he learns to code. It will be a place for Drew to catalog his thoughts and help him process his learning. Maybe one day it can be a source of information to come back too and help others on their coding journey.</p>

<p>Below will be a catalog of Drew's projects and blog entries to give insight into his problem solving.</p>

<h2><a href="#first-article">Learning HTML</a></h2>
<time datetime="01-12-2021">Jan. 12, 2021</time>
<p>After spending a couple months struggling to learn and understand python. A friend in the tech industry told me to look into learning front end design.He informed me that HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the building blocks to almost every website on the internet. After doing some research on forums, videos, and blogs, I decided it was time to change gears and focus on learning the core languages of front end web design. Starting with HTML.</p>

<p>HTML was very encouraging early on. After really struggling with understanding the concepts of python, it was nice to see the simplicity of using HTML. I learned that it is a mark-up language that is used to help the browser understand the main content of the web page. A way for the programmer to communicate to the browser what the label of each section should be. HTML took only a week or so to fully understand what the concepts were. HTML is not a very flashy language to learn but it is very important to understand so that thte foundation of the website is solid and organized. I visualize HTML to be the bones of the site and that having solid structure and organization will really help out later when the web site gets more complex.</p>

<h2><a href="#second-article">Learning CSS: The Basics</a></h2>
<time datetime="01-13-2021">Jan. 13, 2021</time>
<p>Cascading Style Sheets(CSS) has been a little more challenging than HTML to learn. It has to do with the depth at which CSS can alter the HTML document. CSS is where the styling and art of computer programming comes together to alter the appearance of the website for the user. If HTML is the bones, than CSS is the skin and appearance of the body. CSS allows for a set of rules to be implemented for different element tags. I am learning that CSS has a lot of depth and can be implemented in a lot of creative ways to really make a web site dynamic and visualy appealing to the user. CSS can also make the website easier to navigate and be user friendly for people with disabilities.</p>

<p> CSS is another mark-up language and is seems to be pretty straightforward. List the element you would like to target and then list the changes you would like the browser to apply. Where it gets tricky is knowing the scope of the which rules. Some rules can be set globaly to apply to the whole body tag, while also having the ability to set up IDs to specificly target a certain tag within the HTML. It comes down to what the programer wants to edit and adjust on the website.</p>

<p>I feel like there is so much more to CSS I can still learn. That I am only scratching the surface of it's potential. So far CSS has been my favorite language to learn and implement.</p>

<h2><a href="#third-article">Learning JavaScript</a></h2>
<time datetime="01-22-2021">Jan. 22, 2021</time>
<p> JavaScript has proven to be the hardest of the three languages of front end development. I gained a lot of confidence learning the mark-up languages of HTML and CSS where it is pretty straight forward witht the commands and inputs. While JavaScript seems to be more computational, it seems my hardest lesson is learning and understanding the best way to utilize JavaScript. I need to be better about my practice time with JavaScript and make it more of a daily habit till i fully grasp it. It can be a bit overwhelming at times and makes me feel fatigue. It is for sure the first language that makes me feel the imposter syndrome that comes with programming.</p>

<p>Feeling extra motivated to learn JavaScript this year and start my career in coding. I feel like I am so close to getting over the learning curve of JavaScript. With continued practice I know I will one day eventually master the front end languages. Once I master JavaScript I know it will open the door to many programming and tech opportunities. I like the challenge and cannot wait to taste the sweet flavor of success.</p>
