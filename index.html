<h2><a href="#intro-main">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>Welcome to Drew's Coding Journey! This is a blog to help Drew track his progress from newby to programmer. Drew will be able to showcase his websites and show off some of the technical skills he has learned from his readings and time spent practicing. This site will be comprised of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal will be to test out new skills and develop a fully functioning website. Would like to add a search option to find certain date entries, keywords in the blog, find common ideas and such. Going to use flex box to set up the layout of the website.</p>

<p>Consider this to be a sort of rough draft for Drew's portfolio for when he starts applying for jobs i n the tech field. This blog will supplement his Git Hub and help show recruiters, hiring managers, and companies the progress and thought process Drew has as he learns to code. It will be a place for Drew to catalog his thoughts and help him process his learning. Maybe one day it can be a source of information to come back too and help others on their coding journey.</p>

<h3><strong>Below will be a catalog of Drew's projects and blog entries from newest to oldest post.</strong></h3>

<h2><a href="code_fundamentals.html#twentythird-article"> Visual Studio Code Shortcuts</a></h2>
<time datetime="05-12-2021">May 12, 2021</time>
<p> While watching a video about how to be more productive as a web developer by Andy Sterkowitz, he posted a handy shortcut cheat sheet for visual studio code on both mac and windows. As soon as he mentioned that he posted a pdf I jumped on my email and sent the pdf to my laptop. If I can save even a few minutes of typing that would be such a releif for when I am taking on bigger projects. I am learning that my time is extremely important and I need make sure I am maximizing my output everyday.</p>

<p> I found the video to be helpful with mindset and making sure my priorities are in order wen it comes to decsion making. I posted the link to bottom of this article along with the VS code shortcuts. The cheatsheet will also be in the resources section of the the code_fundamentals archive.</p>

<h2><a href="javascript_archive.html#twentysecond-article"> Writing it down</a></h2>
<time datetime="05-11-2021">May 11, 2021</time>
<p> While practicing JavaScript on CodeWars, I have it found it tremendiously helpful to use a sheet of paper or a word document to write down the problem. It is way easier for me to visualize the problem and take the important parts out of the question. Then writing down the mock code to help me get to the final stage of coding down the answer for the the problem. This may seem like no brainer advice but it has taken me longer than I would like to admit for figuring out this simple tip.</p>

<p> I have had the same epiphany when desinging my projects. Writing down the faux-code and the image in my head down on paper has made the design process a lot easier. I feel like it really helps me flush out my ideas and get a better product once I get going on the code. With each day I am learning these small and simple lessons that are making me feel confident in my ability to code and develop websites. It won't be too much longer before I am job ready.</p>

<h2><a href="code_fundamentals.html#twentyfirst-article"> Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)</a></h2>
<time datetime="05-05-2021">May. 05, 2021</time>
<p> While watching Youtbe I came across a great video from FreeCodeCamp that teaches beginners about application programming interfaces (API). As the video explains, APIs are the functions of programs that the user learns to interact with. APIs are used to make things easier and take the away the complication of what's happening behind the scenes. Like a radio, the user knows how to work the power button, volume and station controls, but has no idea how the inner workings of the radio does that. APIs work the same but for making code.</p>

<p> People have developed shortcuts to make functioons easier to add to websites and allow developers to get creative with already existing code. The video was very informative and has shown me a world of possibilities to add to my coding skills. After watching this video I want to incorporate a project that uses some-sort of web API and create something fun. I am thinking of using Spotify's API because I am a big fan of the platform. Now I just need to think of a clever idea to incorporate it with. I listed the link to the freecodecamp video for reference. </p>

<h2><a href="html_archive.html#twentieth-article"> Labels and Containers</a></h2>
<time datetime="04-29-2021">Apr. 29, 2021</time>
<p> As I am building out a few of my projects I am learning the importance of labeling elements with IDs and placing content into containers. As I build and learn more about CSS and JavaScript I find how important it is to maniuplate through the use of HTML. Being able to seperate sections and content to be manipulated is very useful and allows for flexibity with design. </p>

<p> Where this really shows up is in React JS. The whole framework is built upon using small components to come together and form the functioning website. Through clear labels and containers the website forms these different componets that help the flow of data into the correct componet. Same goes into CSS that can help stylize the particular piece of content on the web page. As I continue to build these web pages I find it very important to think out of the design of the web page and the sections that will need to be declared through the HTML to allow editing and clarity for the next programmer. </p>

<h2><a href="react_archive.html#nineteenth-article"> Learning through React through a tutorial</h2></a>
<time datetime="04-28-2021">Apr. 28, 2021</time>
<p> I found web developer on Youtube that had some great information on getting into web development and the basics one needs to know to be job ready for this field. I found a tutorial he posted on learning react with a simple to-do/ task-manager. I thought I would give it a try and follow along for my first react project. Though he is very knowledgeable I find that he is not a great teacher. He breezes through the code and complex ideas introduced through react without teaching what is really going on. I find it hard to keep up and kow which parts are important and find myself just copying what he types without knowing what I am really doing. </p>

<p> I have found tutorial in the past with better teachers and felt like I have learned a great deal of knowledge from the tutorials. With this one I feel that I am just wasting my time and just copying and pasting someone else's work. I feel that I am cheating on this project and that I am only hurting myself. I will continue to follow along with the tutorial but I do not think that I will post this project on github or try to spin-it as my own work. Rather use it as a way to get my first taste of what it's like working with the react libary. A valuable lesson from this is that not all experts are great teachers. </p>

<h2><a href="code_fundamentals.html#eighteenth-article"> Revisiting Old Projects</h2></a>
<time datetime="04-19-2021">Apr. 19, 2021</time>
<p> As I continue learning and getting closer to being job ready for the coding industry, I am going back to old projects I have created and looking over the code to see if I can make any imporvements. I was shocked at how sloppy my first project was. The organization was terrible, half of the pages were half done, and it was not very impressive. It was a fun challenge to back and mess around with structure of the HTML and CSS of the page to get a cleaner design on the page. Also worked on adding more link paths to make the navigation a lot easier for the user. </p>

<p> It has been a releif to see that I have come a long way in my coding journey and that my hard work is paying off. For a while I believed that I was putting in work on my projects without learning or taking any lessons out of it. With revisiting my old project I have learned a ton of small lessons that have transfered into cleaner and better code. Seeing this has motivated me to work even harder. I will continue to push myself to learn more and learn how to become a top notch developer.  </p>

<h2><a href="react_archive.html#seventeenth-article"> Learning React</h2></a>
<time datetime="04-09-2021">Apr. 09, 2021</time>
<p> Now that I am feeling comfortable with the bsics of JavaScript, I feel confident enough to learn how to use React.JS. I have spent the last week watching videos and reading the documentation on how to use it and I think I am starting to see the pattern in the design. I have learned that React is a libary and not actually a framework. It makes react pretty easy to incorporate into projects. I have also learned that React can use vanilla JavaScript syntax to use most of react's methods. I am still trying to learn and understand JSX and how Babel is used to translate the code but I am slowly understanding how it all connects. </p>

<p> My goal is for the next day off from work is to start my next project and have React be a big componet so I can practice and get familiar with the libary and how to use it. It seems pretty straight-forward with how to build componets and understanding how the flow of data is in only one direction. I feel that I might be missing some of the small nuanced uses and set-ups for it to work properly on a project. Reeact has been very exciting to learn and has really spiced up JavaScript for me. I just need to decide on a project to build and I'll be on my way! </p>

<h2><a href="code_fundamentals.html#sixteenth-article">Build to learn</a></h2>
<time datetime="03-29-2021">Mar. 29, 2021</time>
<p> I have spent the last six months learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and once of the best ways for me to absorb and understand how these languages work is to practice using the lessons that I have learned. I have found that tinkering with the newly learn code really helps me understand how it works and the limitations to the abilities of the language. If I do not put in the physical practice of using the new code I find that I do not retain the lessons as welll as compared to the lessons I practice and implement into my projects. </p>

<p> Like any skill learning to code requires practice and repetition to create the neural connections in the brain. The more routine it becomes the easier it will become to master. I am really focusing on coding everyday so that I get a little bit better and can understand how this new complex world of software works. My next goal is to learn and understand React.JS. I believe this will help further my understanding of JavaScript and make one step closer to employable in front-end development. </p>

<h2><a href="project_ideas.html#fifteenth-article">Calorie Counter</a></h2>
<time datetime="03-26-2021">Mar. 26, 2021</time>
<p> An idea I have for a calculator is make a calorie calculator. The idea is for a simpiler way for people to count and track their calorie intake. People can input the foods they eat for the day, the calories burned from working out, and equate their basal metabolic calorie burn. I also want this calculatorto track the users progress so they can see if they are in a caloric deficit or in a caloric surplus for their fitness goals. Having a feature to show how many days in a row that they have hit their goals and give a visual chart to show how consistent they have been and promote lifestyle change.</p>

<p> This idea came to me after watching my girlfriend struggle with tracking her claoires and try and use her my fitness pal. I want to make an application that makes it easier to track and monitor the users calories. Being able to track calories is a powerful tool for people looking to lose weight or even put weight on. Though the market for calorie counters is pretty weak and has a lot of room for improvment. I feel that with my expierince in the fitness world and my new development skills put me in a unique position to make useful tool to help users track their calories. </p>

<time datetime="03-25-2021">Mar. 25, 2021</time>
<p> After talking to a friend in the tech industry, I have decided to start learning react while I learn JavaScripts more advanced lessons. I am understanding the basics of JavaScript and need to practice the implementing and more advanced cocepts. My friend sent a great article from 2020 that gave some great insights into learning react (Link to blog post at the bottom). </p>

<p> I have learned so far that React.js is a libary and not a framework, even though many still call it a framework, and that it is one of the most used tools in current web development. As I was reading thos article I discovered more tools that I can add to my web development tool belt in the future to help make my websites even better. But for now I am going to keep my focus on React and learn the basics of the libary. </p>

<h2><a href="javascript_archive.html#thirteenth-article">User Interaction: Alert, Prompt, & Confirm</a></h2>
<time datetime="03-21-2021">Mar. 21, 2021</time>
<p> The browser gives us a few functions to interact with our users. Alert will display a message on the screen. The user must acknowledge the window before moving onto the rest of the page by pressing ok. Next is the Prompt function, which takes two arguments and can ask a user a question and allows the user to input an answer. And lastly we have the Confirm function which will give the user a question and two options: Ok or cancel. This will tanslate into True if OK is selected and False if canceled is selected. </p>

<p> All three functions are handy to have for big website design and can be used as tools to help test or debug a site. They are fairly disruptive on a web page and should be lmited in their use. But for instances of purchases and big desions for the user these options can be usefulto help guide the user. I am looking forward to learning more useful functions to help me master JavaScript.</p>

<h2><a href="project_ideas.html#twelfth-article">Project Idea: Rebuilding Company Websites</a></h2>
<time datetime="03-15-2021">Mar. 15, 2021</time>
<p>As I have entered the workforce I have worked with a few different companies that do not specialize in technology and in turn had a weak online presence. Their websites were poorly designed and were not easy to navigate or were not informative to the user. While working with these companies I had been told multiple times by customers that they could not find or understand how to use the company site. I see this as a great opportunity. </p>

<p>My idea for a project is to redesign the page and make it easier for the user to use and navigate. In first companies case, they are based out of Germany and were ttrying to start their business in the USA. Their main needs are to Americanize their site and be more direct with their information. Instead of using easy tag-lines they would use long winded sentances/paragraphs to tell the user what they do. They also seemed to have parts that seemed to be copied and pasted into Google translate because of how bad the the english was. With this site it is simplifing the navigation and making the information condensed. </p>

<p>For the second company their main issue is that they have not updated their website since the 90's/early 2000's. Very dated looking and pretty slow and clunky navigation. This website would be fun to redesign and freshen up so that it looks modern and and speed up the use of the site. Maybe have some connection to the social media accounts for the website. Both these sites would be a fun challenge and could be a great opportunity to help my past employers.</p>

<h2><a href="python_archive.html#eleventh-article">Python Path</a></h2>
<time datetime="03-11-2021">Mar. 11, 2021</time>
<p>When I first started learning to code, I relied on the opnion of people in coding community formums and YouTube to decide which language I should start with. The general opinion was that python is the future of coding and would be a great language to start with. I spent about 3 months reading and watching tutorials to try and grasp the concepts that make python. While the syntax was easy to understand and construct, I found it really challenging figuring out what I could do with these data structures. </p>

<p> Once I hit a point of uncertanty and did not know what to do next I reached out to a friend that works with back-end stack and uses SQL databases. He recommended I get a start with front-end stack and learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It was a total game changer and really got me excited about learning more about coding. I loved being able to see what I was creating and see the magic of web development. </p>

<p>While I have been enjoying the front-end stack and learning web development, I would one day like to come back and relearn python and add it to my understanding of programming. Python has been a great foundation for JavaScript and helping breeze through the fundamentals and knowing what each data structure is and how it is used. Python will be a handy tool to have down road and I cannot wait to learn it again. </p>

<time datetime="03-10-2021">Mar. 10, 2021</time>
<p>Coding is a whole other universe with its own set of rules. There is so much knowledge to learn and absorb that it can be overwhelming. I can be a bit of a perfectionist when it comes to learning and understanding a topic that I get lost in all the information. I want to try and learn everything about a topic all at once and become a master of a language in no time. </p>

<p>I find myself losing motivation when I get overwhelmed by the sheer volume of information, I know I must learn. I need to reshape my view of the journey ahead. I will not become a programmer without taking my time and practicing a little bit everyday. Use a big chocalate bar as imagery. I will just nibble away at the choclate bar until it is all gone, bit by bit and day by day. One day I will get there. Patience and disipline will be important on this coding journey. </p>

<time datetime="03-08-2021">Mar. 08, 2021</time>
<p> As I practice and continue learning more about CSS I am seeing the depth of the language and it is truly an amazing language. With just the basics you can apply colors and fonts you want but that is just the simple uses for the language. I am learning CSS can help structure the webpage using CSS Grid or through flex box layout. Both call upon the HTML elements to create a structure for the page to appear aestheically pleasing and easier to read and navigate. </p>

<p> CSS also has the power to make the website feel for responive to the user with changes in appearances with whatever the size of the screen the user is accessing the page from. By using media queries the document can change its styling to improve its readability for the user. A clever way to simlify the code and put it all in one spot instead of giving the browser more documents to read. CSS can also apply some animation to the page to be more dynamic. I still have much to learn about CSS but excited to see what other cool features this language has. </p>

<p> As I am practicing and learning the basics of JavaScript (JS) I am learning that JS is a language that can manipulate the HTML document. I feel like I am now starting to understand how HTML, CSS, and JS mesh and blend together to get the internet we see today. I like to understand the bigger picture of how anything works and exists with the world around it. It has taken some time but after months of studying and practicing I think I am starting to understand how JS operates. </p>

<p> Just going over the basics of JS has been long but has really helped create a strong foundation for me moving forward. The ideas really clicked together once I started learning about ECMAscript 6 and the current practices of JS. I was able to see some practice code that incorporates the HTML elements and JS incorporates it into its own code. I still have much too learn on JS but I feel like I have finally have a small grasp of how I will be using JS in my own code in the future. A little practice everyday and I will understand JS in no time!</p>

<time datetime="03-01-2021">Mar. 01, 2021</time>
<p> An idea that I have been thinking over for a project down the road is making an application that can help music fans find shows and festivals in their area or in an area of interest. It could be a powerful tool for people to discover new music or follow their favorite artists. Being a music fan, I find it hard sometimes to find new festivals or local shows. This could be a great directory for users to search and plan events for vacations or plan some bucket-list events. </p>

<p> The way I envisoned the application working is the user can put in a search radius they are willing to travel, and the application will compile a list of every music event going on in the area and list the events in order of date with shows for the day coming up at the top of the search. I would like to have some filters for the application to help users find more specific events. For example, if they want only festivals, a specific genre of music, or to even narrow down a specifiv venue if the user knows where the artists are gonna play. This could be a super helpful tool to help make music expieriences more accessible for all. </p>

<h2><a href="html_archive.html#sixth-article">Understanding HTML</a></h2>
<time datetime="02-26-2021">Feb. 26, 2021</time>
<p> The way I view HTML is our way of communicating to the machine how to label each bit of data we want to display for the user. The programmer can be as creative as they want to be with the tags, they want to use for each piece of data they feed into the mahine. Though if the programmer gets too creative it can confuse other programmers that will look at the code next. I have learned that there is plenty of speicalty tags to give each piece of information so that you can manipulate with css rules later and can get real creatvie with the webpage design. </p>

<p> As I learn and practice more, I learn that there is so many creative ways to label and manipulate the document. Slowly learning that HTML has more capabilities than just putting a label on a paragragh of words. That the structure we give the document is important to the foundation of the web page. Clean and organized structure will make the code much easier to understand and maintain. </p>

<h2><a href="code_fundamentals.html#fifth-article">Coding Fundamentals: Consistency is Key</a></h2>
<time datetime="02-17-2021">Feb. 17, 2021</time>
<p> With coding fundamentals I will be talking about key lessons learned while in my coding journey. Ideas and topics that will be helpful to revisit and teach other learn lessons that are important to me. The first one will be about the lesson of perseverance and consistency. These lessons and skills are not only important for coding but in life in general. </p>

<p> I have found that coding is like fitness, in that to become great and be the envy of everyone in the field is a long journey of working hard and being consistent. To see results with weight training one must be consistent with lifting heavy weights on a regular baisis. To be able to run a marathon one must have regular running routine. Similarly, I have learned that to learn code one must find a routine and practice regularly. I have found that when I am consistent with my coding practice the skills seem to stick in my head and become natural to me. I create a new route for my brin to function. </p>

<p> When I take a break or lose motivation from coding, I find it to be hard to get back into the rythm of learning and practicing. Through just getting a little bit done for coding I can use the 1% of getting better and let it grow over time. That 1% will continue to grow each day and compound into mastery of the language. The goal should not be to rush through the lessons and learn the concepts fast, but to truly learn the lesson and take my time learning the concepts. When I feel lack of motivation, I need to remember that action will help show me success, which will in turn help me create motivation and momentum in learning. Even if you feel dumb, keep learning and practicing. Eventually it will amount into mastery! </p>

<h2><a href="project_ideas.html#fourth-article">Project Idea #1: Change of address directory</a></h2>
<time datetime="02-10-2021">Feb. 10, 2021</time>
<p> I have been so busy working on fine-tuning this website that I have been forgetting to log entries in along the way. This post will be the first article for the project ideas page. This project came to me as I am getting ready to move this weekend. The idea is it will be a directory of all the organizations and services needed to be contacted for a move. The idea came to me as I stressed over thinking about all my mail, voter registration, and setting up the utilities. I have not done any research into it but it seems like it would be a handy tool to have. All the services and contact information for everything needed for a move. </p>

<p> The idea is to create a site that is an all-in-one site where the user logs-in and can track all the different authorities they need to contact about a change of address. List the agencies name, the current address they have listed and a link to where the user must go to change the address listed. For mail, voting, deliveries, MVD, car registration and such like that. A quick way for those who move to keep all their information up to date. Creating submission forms with all the relevant information and then creating forms for the user to see all the services and organizations needed to contact before the list. Almost like a to-do list for moving, but the site comes with all the relevant contact information. </p>

<p>It seems like a fun twist on a normal to-do list while also incorporating fun new lessons and challenges for me to take on. This idea has been fun to think and flush out and cannot wait to get started on it. </p>

<time datetime="01-22-2021">Jan. 22, 2021</time>
<p> JavaScript has proven to be the hardest of the three languages of front-end development. I gained a lot of confidence learning the mark-up languages of HTML and CSS where it is straight forward with the commands and inputs. While JavaScript seems to be more computational, it seems my hardest lesson is learning and understanding the best way to utilize JavaScript. I need to be better about my practice time with JavaScript and make it more of a daily habit till i fully grasp it. It can be a bit overwhelming at times and makes me feel fatigue. It is for sure the first language that makes me feel the imposter syndrome that comes with programming. </p>

<p>Feeling extra motivated to learn JavaScript this year and start my career in coding. I feel like I am so close to getting over the learning curve of JavaScript. With continued practice I know I will one day eventually master the front-end languages. Once I master JavaScript, I know it will open the door to many programming and tech opportunities. I like the challenge and cannot wait to taste the sweet flavor of success. </p>

<p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) has been a little more challenging than HTML to learn. It has to do with the depth at which CSS can alter the HTML document. CSS is where the styling and art of computer programming comes together to alter the appearance of the website for the user. If HTML is the bones, then CSS is the skin and appearance of the body. CSS allows for a set of rules to be implemented for different element tags. I am learning that CSS has a lot of depth and can be implemented in a lot of creative ways to really make a web site dynamic and visually appealing to the user. CSS can also make the website easier to navigate and be user friendly for people with disabilities. </p>

<p> CSS is another mark-up language and is seems to be straightforward. List the element you would like to target and then list the changes you would like the browser to apply. Where it gets tricky is knowing the scope of the which rules. Some rules can be set globally to apply to the whole-body tag, while also having the ability to set up IDs to specifically target a certain tag within the HTML. It comes down to what the programmer wants to edit and adjust on the website. </p>

<p>I feel like there is so much more to CSS I can still learn. That I am only scratching the surface of its potential. So far CSS has been my favorite language to learn and implement. </p>

<p>After spending a couple months struggling to learn and understand python. A friend in the tech industry told me to look into learning front end design. He informed me that HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the building blocks to almost every website on the internet. After doing some research on forums, videos, and blogs, I decided it was time to change gears and focus on learning the core languages of front-end web design. Starting with HTML. </p>

<p>HTML was very encouraging early on. After really struggling with understanding the concepts of python, it was nice to see the simplicity of using HTML. I learned that it is a mark-up language that is used to help the browser understand the main content of the web page. A way for the programmer to communicate to the browser what the label of each section should be. HTML took only a week or so to fully understand what the concepts were. HTML is not a very flashy language to learn but it is important to understand so that thte foundation of the website is solid and organized. I visualize HTML to be the bones of the site and that having solid structure and organization will really help out later when the web site gets more complex. </p>
