<h1> Drew's Coding Journey</h1>
<div id="intro-main"><!--This allows for the linking of atricles so users can find articles easier. This is a test on the main introduction to show how it works and help set up the links for the articles.-->
<h2><a href="#intro-main">Introduction</a></h2>
<p class="center-align">Welcome to Drew's Coding Journey! This is a blog to help Drew track his progress from newby to programmer. Drew will be able to showcase his websites and show off some of the technical skills he has learned from his readings and time spent practicing. This site will be comprised of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal will be to test out new skills and develop a fully functioning website. Would like to add a search option to find certain date entries, keywords in the blog, find common ideas and such. Going to use flex box to set up the layout of the website.</p>

<p>Consider this to be a sort of rough draft for Drew's portfolio for when he starts applying for jobs i n the tech field. This blog will supplement his Git Hub and help show recruiters, hiring managers, and companies the progress and thought process Drew has as he learns to code. It will be a place for Drew to catalog his thoughts and help him process his learning. Maybe one day it can be a source of information to come back too and help others on their coding journey.</p>

<p>Below will be a catalog of Drew's projects and blog entries to give insight into his problem solving.</p>
