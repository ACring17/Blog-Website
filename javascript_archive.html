<p>This is the JavaScript collection of thoughts and resources made by Drew. This is a great resource for those looking to learn JavaScript or to find some tips and tricks. Make sure to check the time stamp to get the most relevant information. As with any language JavaScript evolves and new standard practices are introduced. The older posts will still be available for some nuggets of information.</p></div>

<h2><a href="index.html#twentysecond-article"> Writing it down</a></h2>
<time datetime="05-11-2021">May 11, 2021</time>
<p> While practicing JavaScript on CodeWars, I have it found it tremendiously helpful to use a sheet of paper or a word document to write down the problem. It is way easier for me to visualize the problem and take the important parts out of the question. Then writing down the mock code to help me get to the final stage of coding down the answer for the the problem. This may seem like no brainer advice but it has taken me longer than I would like to admit for figuring out this simple tip.</p>

<p> I have had the same epiphany when desinging my projects. Writing down the faux-code and the image in my head down on paper has made the design process a lot easier. I feel like it really helps me flush out my ideas and get a better product once I get going on the code. With each day I am learning these small and simple lessons that are making me feel confident in my ability to code and develop websites. It won't be too much longer before I am job ready.</p>

<h2><a href="index.html#fourteenth-article">Learning React</a></h2>
<time datetime="03-25-2021">Mar. 25, 2021</time>
<p> After talking to a friend in the tech industry, I have decided to start learning react while I learn JavaScripts more advanced lessons. I am understanding the basics of JavaScript and need to practice the implementing and more advanced cocepts. My friend sent a great article from 2020 that gave some great insights into learning react (Link to blog post at the bottom). </p>

<p> I have learned so far that React.js is a libary and not a framework, even though many still call it a framework, and that it is one of the most used tools in current web development. As I was reading thos article I discovered more tools that I can add to my web development tool belt in the future to help make my websites even better. But for now I am going to keep my focus on React and learn the basics of the libary. </p>

<h2><a href="index.html#thirteenth-article">User Interaction: Alert, Prompt, & Confirm</a></h2>
<time datetime="03-21-2021">Mar. 21, 2021</time>
<p> The browser gives us a few functions to interact with our users. Alert will display a message on the screen. The user must acknowledge the window before moving onto the rest of the page by pressing ok. Next is the Prompt function, which takes two arguments and can ask a user a question and allows the user to input an answer. And lastly we have the Confirm function which will give the user a question and two options: Ok or cancel. This will tanslate into True if OK is selected and False if canceled is selected. </p>

<p> All three functions are handy to have for big website design and can be used as tools to help test or debug a site. They are fairly disruptive on a web page and should be lmited in their use. But for instances of purchases and big desions for the user these options can be usefulto help guide the user. I am looking forward to learning more useful functions to help me master JavaScript.</p>

<h2><a href="index.html#eighth-article">Understanding JavaScript</a></h2>
<time datetime="03-07-2021">Mar. 07, 2021</time>
<p> As I am practicing and learning the basics of JavaScript (JS) I am learning that JS is a language that can manipulate the HTML document. I feel like I am now starting to understand how HTML, CSS, and JS mesh and blend together to get the internet we see today. I like to understand the bigger picture of how anything works and exists with the world around it. It has taken some time but after months of studying and practicing I think I am starting to understand how JS operates. </p>

<p> Just going over the basics of JS has been long but has really helped create a strong foundation for me moving forward. The ideas really clicked together once I started learning about ECMAscript 6 and the current practices of JS. I was able to see some practice code that incorporates the HTML elements and JS incorporates it into its own code. I still have much too learn on JS but I feel like I have finally have a small grasp of how I will be using JS in my own code in the future. A little practice everyday and I will understand JS in no time!</p>

<h2><a href="index.html#third-article">Learning JavaScript</a></h2>
<time datetime="01-22-2021">Jan. 22, 2021</time>
<p> JavaScript has proven to be the hardest of the three languages of front-end development. I gained a lot of confidence learning the mark-up languages of HTML and CSS where it is straight forward with the commands and inputs. While JavaScript seems to be more computational, it seems my hardest lesson is learning and understanding the best way to utilize JavaScript. I need to be better about my practice time with JavaScript and make it more of a daily habit till i fully grasp it. It can be a bit overwhelming at times and makes me feel fatigue. It is for sure the first language that makes me feel the imposter syndrome that comes with programming. </p>

<p>Feeling extra motivated to learn JavaScript this year and start my career in coding. I feel like I am so close to getting over the learning curve of JavaScript. With continued practice I know I will one day eventually master the front-end languages. Once I master JavaScript, I know it will open the door to many programming and tech opportunities. I like the challenge and cannot wait to taste the sweet flavor of success. </p>
