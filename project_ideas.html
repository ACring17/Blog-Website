<h2><a href="index.html#fifteenth-article">Calorie Counter</a></h2>
<time datetime="03-26-2021">Mar. 26, 2021</time>
<p> An idea I have for a calculator is make a calorie calculator. The idea is for a simpiler way for people to count and track their calorie intake. People can input the foods they eat for the day, the calories burned from working out, and equate their basal metabolic calorie burn. I also want this calculatorto track the users progress so they can see if they are in a caloric deficit or in a caloric surplus for their fitness goals. Having a feature to show how many days in a row that they have hit their goals and give a visual chart to show how consistent they have been and promote lifestyle change.</p>

<p> This idea came to me after watching my girlfriend struggle with tracking her claoires and try and use her my fitness pal. I want to make an application that makes it easier to track and monitor the users calories. Being able to track calories is a powerful tool for people looking to lose weight or even put weight on. Though the market for calorie counters is pretty weak and has a lot of room for improvment. I feel that with my expierince in the fitness world and my new development skills put me in a unique position to make useful tool to help users track their calories. </p>

<h2><a href="index.html#twelfth-article">Project Idea: Rebuilding Company Websites</a></h2>
<time datetime="03-15-2021">Mar. 15, 2021</time>
<p>As I have entered the workforce I have worked with a few different companies that do not specialize in technology and in turn had a weak online presence. Their websites were poorly designed and were not easy to navigate or were not informative to the user. While working with these companies I had been told multiple times by customers that they could not find or understand how to use the company site. I see this as a great opportunity. </p>

<p>My idea for a project is to redesign the page and make it easier for the user to use and navigate. In first companies case, they are based out of Germany and were ttrying to start their business in the USA. Their main needs are to Americanize their site and be more direct with their information. Instead of using easy tag-lines they would use long winded sentances/paragraphs to tell the user what they do. They also seemed to have parts that seemed to be copied and pasted into Google translate because of how bad the the english was. With this site it is simplifing the navigation and making the information condensed. </p>

<p>For the second company their main issue is that they have not updated their website since the 90's/early 2000's. Very dated looking and pretty slow and clunky navigation. This website would be fun to redesign and freshen up so that it looks modern and and speed up the use of the site. Maybe have some connection to the social media accounts for the website. Both these sites would be a fun challenge and could be a great opportunity to help my past employers.</p>

<h2><a href="index.html#seventh-article">Music Festival Finder</a></h2>
<time datetime="03-01-2021">Mar. 01, 2021</time>
<p> An idea that I have been thinking over for a project down the road is making an application that can help music fans find shows and festivals in their area or in an area of interest. It could be a powerful tool for people to discover new music or follow their favorite artists. Being a music fan, I find it hard sometimes to find new festivals or local shows. This could be a great directory for users to search and plan events for vacations or plan some bucket-list events. </p>

<p> The way I envisoned the application working is the user can put in a search radius they are willing to travel, and the application will compile a list of every music event going on in the area and list the events in order of date with shows for the day coming up at the top of the search. I would like to have some filters for the application to help users find more specific events. For example, if they want only festivals, a specific genre of music, or to even narrow down a specifiv venue if the user knows where the artists are gonna play. This could be a super helpful tool to help make music expieriences more accessible for all. </p>

<h2><a href="index.html#fourth-article">Project Idea #1: Change of address directory</a></h2><!--Link this back to index-->
<time datetime="02-10-2021">Feb. 10, 2021</time>
<p> I have been so busy working on fine-tuning this website that I have been forgetting to log entries in along the way. This post will be the first article for the project ideas page. This project came to me as I am getting ready to move this weekend. The idea is it will be a directory of all the organizations and services needed to be contacted for a move. The idea came to me as I stressed over thinking about all my mail, voter registration, and setting up the utilities. I have not done any research into it but it seems like it would be a handy tool to have. All the services and contact information for everything needed for a move. </p>

<p> The idea is to create a site that is an all-in-one site where the user logs-in and can track all the different authorities they need to contact about a change of address. List the agencies name, the current address they have listed and a link to where the user must go to change the address listed. For mail, voting, deliveries, MVD, car registration and such like that. A quick way for those who move to keep all their information up to date. Creating submission forms with all the relevant information and then creating forms for the user to see all the services and organizations needed to contact before the list. Almost like a to-do list for moving, but the site comes with all the relevant contact information. </p>

<p>It seems like a fun twist on a normal to-do list while also incorporating fun new lessons and challenges for me to take on. This idea has been fun to think and flush out and cannot wait to get started on it. </p>
