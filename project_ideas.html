<h2><a href="index.html#fourth-article">Project Idea #1: Change of address directory</a></h2>
<time datetime="02-10-2021">Feb. 10, 2021</time>
<p> I have been so busy working on fine-tuning this website that I have been forgetting to log enrties in along the way. This post will be the the first article for the project ideas page. This project came to me as I am getting ready to move this weekend. The idea is it will be a directory of all the organizations and services needed to be contacted for a move. The idea came to me as I stressed over thinking about all my mail, voter registration, and setting up the utilities. I have not done any research into it but it seems like it would be a handy tool to have. All the services and contact information for everything needed for a move.</p>

<p> The idea is to create a site that is an all in one site where the user logs-in and can track all the different authorities they need to contact about a change of address. List the agencies name, the current address they have listed and a link to where the user must go to change the address listed. For mail, voting, deliveries, MVD, car registration and such like that. A quick way for those who move to keep all their information up to date. Creating submition forms with all the relevant information and then creating forms for the user to see all the services and organizations needed to contact before the list. Almost like a todo list for moving, but the site comes with all the relevant contact information.</p>

<p>It seems like a fun twist on a normal todo list while also incorporating fun new lessons and challenges for me to take on. This idea has beeen fun to think and flush out and cannot wait to get started on it.</p>
